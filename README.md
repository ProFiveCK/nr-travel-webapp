# Travel Application Stack – Admin Guide

## Overview
This application enables users to submit travel requests, which are then reviewed and approved through a multi‑stage workflow. It is built with a **Node.js/Express** backend and a **React** frontend, both written in **TypeScript**, and uses **PostgreSQL** for data storage. The system also supports LDAP authentication.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js (v20) with Express, written in **TypeScript**. Uses `pg` for PostgreSQL interaction and `ldapjs` for LDAP authentication.
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) with **TypeScript** and vanilla CSS for styling. UI components follow a modern, responsive design.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, schema defined in `backend/src/services/database.ts`.
- **Containerisation**: Docker Compose orchestrates the backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Mailpit services.
- **Authentication**: Supports local password authentication and optional LDAP integration.

## Quick Start for Admins
1. Ensure Docker is running.
2. From the project root run `docker compose up -d --build`.
3. Access the admin panel at `https://travel.naurufinance.info` (or the configured client URL).
4. Use the **Settings** tab to configure LDAP, email, and upload settings.
5. Manage departments via **Department Profiles** in the admin UI.
